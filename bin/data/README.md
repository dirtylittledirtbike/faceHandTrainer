# faceHandTrainer
hand_detector.svm was trained with a 96 x 96 sliding window and c value of 11 and hand_detector2.svm was trained with a sliding window of 100 x 100 pixels with c value of 6. The images were not upsampled since the size of the bounding boxes doesnt vary significantly. Both detectors were trained on the all_hands2 dataset.
